# Python Projects

This repository contains small Python projects and experiments developed while learning
data structures, algorithms, graph theory, and machine learning.

The goal of this repository is to explore concepts through code, test ideas, and build
a solid understanding by implementing things from scratch whenever possible.

## Scope
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Graphs and graph algorithms
- Machine learning 
- Experiments and learning-oriented implementations

## Notes
The code in this repository is educational and experimental.
It is not necessarily optimized and may change frequently as concepts are refined and improved!! c:
